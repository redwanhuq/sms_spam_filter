    "After watching the film *Arrival*, I developed a deep appreciation for the field of linguistics (also my favorite movie of 2016). Human language is the most unstructured type of data, and yet we effortlessly parse and interpret it, and even generate our own. On the other hand, understanding everyday language is a significant challenge for machines; this is the focus of **natural language processing** (NLP)&mdash;the crossroads between linguistics and AI. In this post, we'll make use of some NLP concepts and combine them with machine learning to build a spam filter for SMS text messages.\n",

    "In the 1950s, Alan Turing conjectured if a machine can fool a human into believing that he/she is speaking with another human, the machine exhibits intelligence&mdash;the iconic Turing test. Recently, a machine arguably passed the Turing test [for the first time](http://www.reading.ac.uk/news-and-events/releases/PR583836.aspx); the milestone was largely attributed to advances in NLP. If you've ever wondered how Siri or Google recognizes your voice, makes sense of a semantically nebulous question, such as \"How did the Celtics do?\", and returns an accurate response, that's also NLP in action! The war on spam is another.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before Gmail implemented its incredible spam filter, I remember crafting an elaborate set of if/then rules for words typically found in spam. Not surprisingly, it was tedious and prone to mistakes. Nowadays, no one hand codes a spam filter&mdash;we train machines to do the job! But email spam is different from SMS message spam; we tend to speak more casually on our phones, using more slang, incomplete sentences, or even concocting words and phrases. Let's see what machine learning can do for SMS message spam.\n",

    "To get the best of both worlds, let's tokenize unigrams *and* bigrams. As an example, unigrams and bigrams for \"The quick brown fox\" are \"The\", \"quick\", \"brown\", \"fox\", \"The quick\", \"quick brown\" and \"brown fox\".\n",

    "Having selected a tokenization strategy, the next step is assign each $n$-gram to a feature and then compute the $n$-gram's frequency using some statistic. Again, we have options.\n",
    "\n",
    "One statistic called **term frequency (tf)** tallies the occurrences of each $n$-gram for every training example. However, some $n$-grams will undoubtedly show up often in any given SMS message, while others rarely appear in the overall corpus but show up frequently in certain *subsets* of messages such as spam. Therefore, to emphasize the latter, more interesting set of $n$-grams, we'll downweight the term frequency with **inverse document frequency (idf)**, which is calculated by logarithmically scaling the inverse of the fraction of training examples that contain a given term. Combining these two statistics yields the tf-idf statistic:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\textrm{tf-idf}(t, i) = \\textrm{tf}(t, i) \\times \\textrm{idf}(t) = \\textrm{tf}(t, i) \\times \\log\\bigg(\\frac{M}{m_t}\\bigg)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\textrm{tf}(t,i)$ is the term frequency for term $t$ in the $i$th training example, $M$ is the total number of training examples, and $m_t$ is the number of training examples that contain the term $t$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Scikit-learn has an off-the-shelf tool called `TfidfVectorizer` that performs $n$-gram tokenization and also computes the tf-idf statistic. Two technical details regarding `TfidfVectorizer`: a) the tf-idf statistic is computed [slightly differently](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/feature_extraction.html#tfidf-term-weighting) to avoid division by zero, and b) the computed tf-idf values for each training example are subsequently [normalized](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/feature_extraction.html#tfidf-term-weighting).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Finally, we're equipped to transform a corpus of text data into a matrix of numbers with one row per training example and one column per $n$-gram.**"

To perform linear algebra computations rapidly on such a large sparse matrix, it'd be more efficient to store only the non-zero values while maintaining the structure.

In a nutshell, this model attempts to find the hyperplane that best separates the two classes. \n",

In addition, text data is typically [linearly separable to begin with](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/BFb0026683). Finally, we'll use `svm.LinearSVC()` instead of `svm.SVC(kernel='linear')` because the former relies on a library whose [algorithmic complexity](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11508788/whats-the-difference-between-libsvm-and-liblinear) is $O(n)$ instead of $O(n^2)$ or $O(n^3)$, meaning much faster. \n",

    "I love learning curves&mdash;they're teeming with information! Notice the performance on the training set is near perfect regardless of dataset size, which makes sense because we're evaluating the classifier on the same data used to train it. At first, it looks like the classifier is suffering from high variance and is overfitting since the validation scores never reach the same level. However, taking a closer look at the scale of the $y$-axis makes me believe this issue isn't that pronounced. \n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, since the validation scores improve with more training examples, an obvious next step is to acquire more data points. In addition, we could try a smaller set of features by only using bigrams, not unigrams. Finally, it's worth tuning the regularization hyperparameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using nested cross-validation to minimize information leakage\n",
    "\n",
    "To optimize hyperparameters, we can use Scikit-learn's `GridSearchCV` tool, which trains a series of candidate models using every combination of hyperparameters, evaluates each model using $k$-fold cross-validation, and then reports the \"winning\" model and its hyperparameter combination that yielded the best performance. However, we can't report this value as an unbiased estimate of the model's performance because we repeatedly reused the same data for cross-validation&mdash;we potentially \"leaked\" information across the candidate models!\n",
    "\n",
    "What we *can* do is utilize **nested cross-validation** to alleviate this issue. In this procedure, we implement $k$-fold cross-validation to train $k$ models (the outer loop). Using the *training set* of each fold, we perform `GridSearchCV` to tune the hyperparameters and select a winning model (the inner loop). Then, using the *validation set* of each fold, we evaluate the performance of the winning model developed in the inner loop. Finally, by computing the mean of this performance value across the $k$ folds, we can report a robust estimate of the model's performance. This can be a bit confusing so I recommend taking a glance at [this visual representation](https://mlr-org.github.io/mlr-tutorial/devel/html/nested_resampling/index.html) of what's going on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using nested cross-validation, let's test a range of 20 values for the regularization hyperparameter and use 10-fold cross-validation to assess the classifier's performance."

    "# 6. How to improve the model\n",
    "\n",
    "We can attempt to boost the classifier's performance but there's simply too many different avenues. However, I'd like to highlight some of the prominent ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Text preprocessing\n",
    "    * I handcrafted the regular expressions in this post (by no means an expert!) but I'm certain we can increase their matching performance and efficiency. It may be also be worthwhile using regex to normalize other terms such as dates, times, slang, etc.\n",
    "    * I selected the Porter stemmer here but comparing the performance with the Lancaster stemmer would be interesting. However, stemming can be crude and chop off suffixes haphazhardly&mdash;a better alternative is **lemmatization**. For example, the word \"worse\" reduces to \"bad\".\n",
    "    * We ignored the innate features of each training example such as message length, average word length, distribution of the various forms of punctuation, all-caps frequency, etc. Each of these may enhance the classifier's predictive capacity.\n",
    "2. Feature engineering\n",
    "    * I discovered Scikit-learn computes term frequency by simply counting each term. Because SMS messages come in a variety of lengths, normalizing the term frequency to the message length is a good idea.\n",
    "    * You may have noticed most of the top 20 terms listed above are unigrams. This hints that bigrams aren't as useful in this problem&mdash;a bag of words model may be sufficient.\n",
    "3. Machine learning\n",
    "    * Instead of tuning just the classifier's hyperparameters, we can perform a more exhaustive `GridSearchCV` to compare the use of raw term frequencies instead of tf-idf, or perhaps only tokenizing terms that have a term frequency above/below a threshold. In fact, `TfidfVectorizer` includes many other knobs to play with. In addition, we can test other classifiers such as Naive Bayes, logistic regression or a neural net. All of these different options can be investigated simultaneously by combining `GridSearchCV` with Scikit-learn's [`Pipeline` tool](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/model_selection/grid_search_text_feature_extraction.html).\n",
    "    \n",
    "Of course, the biggest issue in this analysis stems from the dataset itself. We discovered the training examples weren't **independently and identically distributed**, which breaks an [important assumption](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/213464/on-the-importance-of-the-i-i-d-assumption-in-statistical-learning) in machine learning. Therefore, to improve the classifier, it's crucial to not only acquire *more* training examples but ensure they all come from the same distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "You probably realized by now that each time you reported an email as spam on Gmail, you were providing Google one more training example to help improve their classifier! I hope this post presented a glimpse of what NLP offers and how it can be combined with machine learning to tackle a real world problem. I've only scratched the surface&mdash;can't wait to dive deeper into the linguistics!\n",
